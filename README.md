# Computational-and-Theoretical-Chemistry
This is targeted to help and play with the algorithms associated with different types of Quantum Mechanical Problems
The repository contain algorithms associated wih certain basic problems we solve in computational and theoretical chemistry
Some of the algorithms will reuquire user input whereas most of the alogriths are supposed to be just copy paste and run
Don't try to change the code,cause it not just the code :)
